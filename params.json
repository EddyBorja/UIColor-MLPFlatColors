{"name":"UIColor+MLPFlatColors","tagline":"A category for UIColor that adds flat UI color methods.","body":"> \"Although the _UIColor_ class comes with built in convenience methods for producing standard colors, most of these colors are too bright and gaudy for any real use other than prototyping. So, here's a category for _UIColor_ that adds 20 new colors that developers may actually want to use in a real app, based off the current trend of flat color schemes. It's called _UIColor+MLPFlatColors_.\" \r\n\r\n![Screenshot](/colorsDemo.png \"Screenshot\")\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n---------\r\n_UIColor+MLPFlatColors_ is a category for _UIColor_ that adds class methods to conveniently produce **20 new colors** designed for flat or semi-flat interface designs. It also adds some methods for choosing a **random color** out of these new colors, and a **macro for converting hex values** to an RGB color. \r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n---------\r\nAdd the _UIColor+MLPFlatColors_ header and implementation file to your project. (.h & .m)\r\n\r\nAfter doing that, you'll be able to produce flat colors by calling the class methods defined in the _MLPFlatColors_ category. Each flat color method is prefixed with the word \"flat\" for easy recognition in Xcode's code complete.\r\n\r\nYou can also produce random flat colors with these methods:\r\n\r\n`+ (UIColor *)randomFlatColor;`\r\n`+ (UIColor *)randomFlatLightColor;`\r\n`+ (UIColor *)randomFlatDarkColor;`\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat to Expect in Future Updates\r\n----------\r\nMore colors and convenience methods related to flat UI themes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCocoapods\r\n-------\r\n\r\nCocoaPods are the best way to manage library dependencies in Objective-C projects.\r\nLearn more at http://cocoapods.org\r\n\r\nAdd this to your podfile to add the UIColor+MLPFlatColors category to your project.\r\n`pod 'UIColor+MLPFlatColors',       '~> 1.0'`\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n--------\r\n_UIColor+MLPFlatColors_ uses the MIT License:\r\n\r\n>Copyright (c) 2013, Mainloop LLC\r\n\r\n>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
