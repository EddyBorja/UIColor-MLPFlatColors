UIColor+MLPFlatColors
================
> Although the _UIColor_ class comes with built in convenience methods for producing standard colors, most of these colors are too bright and gaudy for any real use other than prototyping. So, here's a category for _UIColor_ that adds 20 new colors that developers may actually want to use in a real app, based off the current trend of flat color schemes. It's called _UIColor+MLPFlatColors_.

About
---------
_UIColor+MLPFlatColors_ is a category for _UIColor_ that adds class methods to conveniently produce **20 new colors** designed for flat or semi-flat interface designs. It also adds some methods for choosing a **random color** out of these new colors, and a **macro for converting hex values** to an RGB color. 


Usage
---------
Add the _UIColor+MLPFlatColors_ header and implementation file to your project. (.h & .m)

After doing that, you'll be able to produce flat colors by calling the class methods defined in the _MLPFlatColors_ category. Each flat color method is prefixed with the word "flat" for easy recognition in Xcode's code complete.

You can also produce random flat colors with these methods:

`+ (UIColor *)randomFlatColor;`
`+ (UIColor *)randomFlatLightColor;`
`+ (UIColor *)randomFlatDarkColor;`


What to Expect in Future Updates
----------
More colors and convenience methods related to flat UI themes.
